# MARS ROVERS

A squad of robotic rovers are to be landed by NASA on a plateau on Mars. This plateau, which is
curiously rectangular, must be navigated by the rovers so that their on-board cameras can get a
complete view of the surrounding terrain to send back to Earth.
A rover's position and location is represented by a combination of x and y co-ordinates and a letter
representing one of the four cardinal compass points. The plateau is divided up into a grid to simplify
navigation. An example position might be 0, 0, N, which means the rover is in the bottom
left corner and facing North.

In order to control a rover, NASA sends a simple string of letters. The possible letters are 'L', 'R' and
'M'. 'L' and 'R' makes the rover spin 90 degrees left or right respectively, without moving from its
current spot. 'M' means move forward one grid point, and maintain the same heading.
Assume that the square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1).

### Input:
The first line of input is the upper-right coordinates of the plateau, the lower-left coordinates
are assumed to be 0,0.
The rest of the input is information pertaining to the rovers that have been deployed. Each rover has
two lines of input. The first line gives the rover's position, and the second line is a series of
instructions telling the rover how to explore the plateau.
The position is made up of two integers and a letter separated by spaces, corresponding to the x and
y co-ordinates and the rover's orientation.
Each rover will be finished sequentially, which means that the second rover won't start to move until
the first one has finished moving.

### Output:
The output for each rover should be its final co-ordinates and heading.

#### Example:

Test Input:
```
5 5
1 2 N
LMLMLMLMM
3 3 E
MMRMMRMRRM
```
Expected Output:
```
1 3 N
5 1 E
```

## GraalVM Native Support

This project has been configured to let you generate either a lightweight container or a native executable.
It is also possible to run your tests in a native image.

### Lightweight Container with Cloud Native Buildpacks

If you're already familiar with Spring Boot container images support, this is the easiest way to get started.
Docker should be installed and configured on your machine prior to creating the image.

To create the image, run the following goal:

```
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -Pnative
```

Then, you can run the app like any other container:

```
$ docker run --rm Rovers:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

### Executable with Native Build Tools

Use this option if you want to explore more options such as running your tests in a native image.
The GraalVM `native-image` compiler should be installed and configured on your machine.

NOTE: GraalVM 22.3+ is required.

To create the executable, run the following goal:

```
$ ./mvnw native:compile -Pnative
```

Then, you can run the app as follows:

```
$ target/Rovers
```

You can also run your existing tests suite in a native image.
This is an efficient way to validate the compatibility of your application.

To run your existing tests in a native image, run the following goal:

```
$ ./mvnw test -PnativeTest
```
